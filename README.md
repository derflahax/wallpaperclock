Hello this is a thing that takes a picture and puts the time on it as a copy and sets that as your wallpaper every second.
It is not perfect but it works (kinda) sometimes it breaks and i don't know why.

If you wanna use it you just download it and run the 2 .js files (one is in the folder)
You can ofcourse change the wallpaper (black.png) but make sure to either 
set the res to FHD or go and edit the code to match your res (no guide RN, prob never coming)

- Why is it two files? I hear you ask, well basicly one thing needed require() and another inport from, and
i failed to combine them so i just made two files. Dont worry about getting sued by me by using this. However as i 
stole parts of the code i cant guarantee that anyone else will so dont use this for anything commercial (not that anyone would).

TBH i just wanted to post to github since it was a while. i might post more shit, not sure tho.
